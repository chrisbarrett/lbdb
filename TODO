- Add new modules:
    - Add m_pgp6 for PGP 6.5.1.

- lbdb_dotlock: Have a deep look into the locking mechanism.  Over NFS
  dotlocking may not be enough, it should be combined with fcntl()
  (this should be possible to disable via configure option).  This
  means that we may no longer use mutt_dotlock but always use a
  private lbdb_dotlock.

- fetchaddr: Find out why fetchaddr sometimes runs forever on Solaris 2.6.

- Add man page for configuration file lbdbrc(5) or something like
  this.

- Think about a debug/log mechanism for lbdbq and the modules, so an
  error in a module doesn't imply lbdbq to fail but all other modules
  work as usual and the error messages (and debug informations) are
  written to the logfile (maybe ~/.lbdb/debug).

- lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail: Make the database file configurable.  This
  can be realized in lbdb-fetchaddr via a new option, while m_inmail
  needs a new lbdbrc-variable for this.

- replace m_passwd and m_yppasswd by m_getent, if getent(1) is
  supported by all UNIXes.  Otherwise we need some autoconf magic to
  do the right thing...

- Optimize munge/munge-keeporder to work case-insensitive (at least on
  the domain part of the addresses).

- Add UTF-8 support.
